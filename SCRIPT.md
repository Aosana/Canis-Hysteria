(After encountering rumors of a coven of witches that can cure lycanthropy the Altar of Thorond will be added to the Player’s map. When they travel there a Breton witch will force greet the Player next to the altar.)

Witch: What business do you have here, traveler?

    Player: Who are you?
    
		Witch: I am <Alias.ShortName=CureWitch> of the Beldama Wyrd, I have traveled here from High Rock in order to try and save Solstheim’s fragile ecosystem.
		
			Player: I heard there were witches here that could cure my lycanthropy.
			
				Witch: There was once. Not anymore.
				
				(Continue to “The ecosystem?”)
				
			Player: The ecosystem?
			
				Witch: The witches that live in this cave have abandoned Solstheim and set it on a path of doom. They were once part of my order, dedicated to preserving the delicate balance of the land. However, after the Red Year they lost all hope for Solstheim. They stopped curing the beast blood from those who sought it and as a result the affliction has run rampant these last 200 years.
				
					Player: How can lycanthropy be harmful to Solstheim’s ecosystem?
					
						Witch: You can’t just introduce dozens of new apex predators into an environment and expect everything to continue as normal. The werebeasts here have begun to kill off much of the wildlife. What happens when there is nothing left to eat?
						
							Player: Then you know how to cure lycanthropy?
							
								Witch: Yes. I want to begin offering a cure to those who want it, just giving people the option to rid themselves of the affliction will help control the population here. However, I can only do that if these witches lay dead. They are too powerful for me alone. Help me kill them and I will cure you.
								
									Player: Let’s go kill some witches then.
									
										Witch: Yes, lets.
										
									Player: I’m not interested in being part of your crusade.
									
										Witch: Suit yourself. I’ll be here when you decide you want that cure.

(After killing the witches in the cave.)

Witch: Well that's delt with, thank you stranger. This is the first step to save Solstheim.

	Player: I was glad to help.
	
		I can see your heart is in the right place. Now I believe I owe you something.
		
		(Continue to the cure)
	
	Player: Let’s get on with the cure.
	
		Witch: Very well.

(The cure explantation)

Witch: The beast blood is not easily removed, boons from Daedric Princes never are. There is no simple antidote I can brew to help you, rather we must perform the Rite of the Wolf Giver. We are going to transfer your inner beast to an... animus. You will need to kill the animus, when that is done you will be free of your curse. However, before the fun begins I will need to brew a potion. Go and get some Spriggan Sap and Nightshade and bring it back here.

	Player: What is this animus?
	
		Witch: It's a... capsule in which your inner beast will be able to manifest itself. We need to give it sometimes physical in which it can inhabit when we seperate it from you.
		
	Player: What is this potion for?
		
		Witch: The potion is required in order to prepare the animus for the trasnfer. It is not for drinking. You will understand in time.
		
	Player: Where can I find these things?
	
		Witch: Nightshade is rather common, it grows in many places around Solshteim and Skyrim. If you can't find any, try talking to some alchemists. As for Spriggan Sap, it can be found on the corpses of fallen Spriggan. You may need to get your hands dirty.
		
(Returning with ingrediants)

Witch: Ah excellent. I have a sacrifce prepared outside on the Altar of Thorond.

	Player: A sacrifce?
	
		Witch: Why yes, what did you think the animus was? We will be transfering your inner beast to the corpse of this sacrifce.
		
			Player: I don't know about this.
			
				Witch: Well, do you want to rid yourself of the beast blood? This is the only way.
				
				(Goodbye, Witch will continue outside)
				
			Player: Let's get on with it then.

==
			
(Outside there is a sacrifce prepared on the Altar of Thorond. They are tied up with a dagger next to them.)

(Forcegreet)

Witch: Go ahead. Kill the sacrifce.

	Player: I don't think I can do this.
	
		Witch: Then walk away. Just know that this is the only way to cure yourself.
		
			Player: I will find another way. This is not worth it.
			
				Witch: Unfortunate. Be on your way.
				
				(Quest failed)
				
			Player: I will do it.
	
	Player: If this is the only way...
	
		Witch: It is.
	
	Player: Happily.
	
(After killing the sacrifce.)

Witch: Very good. Retrieve their heart.

	Player: Their heart?
	
		Witch: Yes. Get it for me now.
		
==

(After giving Witch Heart)

Witch: Now I will pour this potion I brew over the heart. Once it is thoroughly dosed you will replace the heart. Then you will finally face your inner beast.

(After dousing heart)

Witch: Now replace it.

==

(After heart is replaced)
	
	
Witch: We are nearly done. I will cast a spell on the corpse. It will revive the animus and imediately force it into its beastial form. That is when you must kill it. Once that has been done you will be free. Are you ready?

	Player: Yes, let's do this.
	
	(Goodbye)
	
	Player: On second thought, I don't think I want to give up the beast blood.
	
		Witch: After all this you are backing out? Seriously?
		
			Player: Yes. I want to keep my beast blood.
			
				Witch: Begone then. I have no further use for you.
				
				(Quest failed)
			
			Player: Nevermind, let's continue.
			
				Witch: Good.
				
==

(After replaceing the heart, out-of-dialogue)

Witch: Get ready. I am going to reanimate the animus now.

==

(After killing the animus)

Witch: Do you feel it? The beast blood leaving you?

	Player: Yes, I can feel the curse lifted.
	
		Witch: Very good. I am going to remain here and keep my services open to anyone else who wishes to rid themselves of the beast blood. Perhaps I will even begin trading with some of the locals, potions are always in demand. If you need me, you know where to find me.
		
		(Quest completed)
	
	Player: I don't feel much different actually.
	
		Witch: Well I know it worked. I can sense it. I am going to remain here and keep my services open to anyone else who wishes to rid themselves of the beast blood. Perhaps I will even begin trading with some of the locals, potions are always in demand. If you need me, you know where to find me.
