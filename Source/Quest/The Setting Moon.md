Canis Hysteria will add a new lore book to the world called "The Rite of the Wolf-Giver". It will inform the Player about a mysterious ritual that Glenmoril Wyrd Covens would perform to cure lycanthropy. It will mention a coven on Solstheim that was infamous for providing the cure during the Bloodmoon prophecies.

It can be found in leveled lists as well as a few static locations:

**Ill Met by Moonlight Locations**

[Bloated Man's Grotto](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bloated_Man%27s_Grotto)\
[Falkreath Barracks](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Falkreath_Barracks)

**Silver Hand Dungeons**

[Driftshade Refuge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Driftshade_Refuge)\
[Dustman's Cairn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dustman%27s_Cairn)\
[Gallows Rock](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Gallows_Rock)

If you are a Companion Werewolf or uninfected the book will simply be a book. However, if you are infected with Canis Hysteria it will trigger a misc quest to find the Wyrd Witches at the [Altar of Thrond](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Altar_of_Thrond) on Solstheim.

Upon traveling to the Altar of Thrond you will find that the Wyrd Witches have since become Hagravens and will attack you. Upon killing them you will find a note on [Ettiene](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ettiene)'s body. Upon reading the note the misc objective will be completed and "The Setting Moon" quest will begin.

The note will detail the process of performing the Rite of the Wolf-Giver.

The first thing that the play will need to do is obtain one Canis Root and one Taproot. Once they get those ingredients they will need to remove the heart from the Nord sacrifice (already present) on the Altar of Thrond at the exterior of the cave.

They will then need to take the ingredients and heart to a cauldron inside the cave. The Player will activate the cauldorn and the ingredients and heart will be removed and replaced with a Heart of the Wolf.

Then the Player will need to go back to the sacrifice and place the Heart of the Wolf into their inventory. Upon doing that a wolf spirit will spawn next to the Player and they will need to fight it off. 

One the spirit has been defeated the Player's lycanthropy will be cured.
